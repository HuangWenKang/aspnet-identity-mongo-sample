A sample of using a [mongodb provider](https://github.com/g0t4/aspnet-identity-mongodb) for the new ASP.NET Identity framework.
This is based on [Microsoft ASP.NET Identity Samples](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Samples).

Read through the commits to see what needs to be changed to get the samples working with MongoDB.
